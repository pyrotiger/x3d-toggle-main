## X3D Toggle - Community Edition

A portable, high-performance utility for managing CCD priority on the AMD Ryzen X3D CPUs utilizing the 3D V-Cache Performance Optimizer under Linux via manual control or automated daemon.

### 🔭  Overview  🔭

This utility provides a graphical interface and automation to the `amd-x3d-vcache` kernel driver. It allows for real-time switching of the CPU scheduler bias to optimize for specific workloads on asymmetric dual-CCD processors (like 7950X3D/9950X3D).

* The Problem: CPPC Latency & Asymmetry
  Current CPPC drivers often fail to switch states deterministically, leading to micro-stutters.

* The Solution: x3d-toggle
  * **C Binary Backend**: The core logic is now a compiled C binary for instant execution and minimal system overhead. Sysfs node detection uses POSIX `glob()` for real-time latency reduction.
  * **Automated Daemon**: Real-time heuristics detect "Gaming" vs "Compute" loads.
  * **Manual Modes**: Instant user-defined priority via GUI or CLI.

### 📜  Prerequisites  📜

* **Linux Kernel**: 6.13 minimum (provides `amd-x3d-vcache` sysfs node); 7.0+ is recommended to take advantage of the daemon's advanced scheduling features (specifically, real-time CPPC dynamic preferred core hinting and zero-latency thread delegation during compute bursts). When coupled with the daemon (and planned eBPF refinements), this brings full feature parity of the Windows AMD 3D V-Cache Performance Optimizer driver to Linux.
* UEFI Configuration: CPPC Dynamic Preferred Cores set to [Driver].
* Build Dependencies: `clang`, `make`, `bpftool`.
* System Dependencies: `polkit`, `libbpf`. (Indirectly utilizes DBus via Polkit and optional GUI components).
* GUI Dependencies (Optional): `yad`, `kdialog`, `libnotify`.

### 🛡️  Architecture Security  🛡️

The utility interfaces with the sysfs node at `/sys/devices/platform/AMDI*/amd_x3d_mode` via PolicyKit.

* **C Binary**: Hardware writes are handled by `x3d-toggle` (installed to `/usr/bin`).
* **Polkit**: Actions are authorized via `org.x3dtoggle.policy`.

X3D Toggle follows a strict **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** philosophy:

* **Backend (Model):** Native C core interacting with `sysfs`, `amd_pstate`, and eBPF.
* **Daemon (Controller):** Orchestrates logic loops and handles IPC requests via UNIX Domain Sockets.
* **XUI (View):** A cross-platform UI logic layer (`x3d-xui`) that synchronizes iconography and formatting between Bash and C components.
* **Frontends (View):** CLI (`x3d-toggle`), Tray Icons, and optional Web/GTK interfaces.

For a deep dive into the system design, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](../documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### 🖥️  XUI (X3D User Interface)  🖥️

The project utilizes a centralized UI definition system called **XUI**. This ensures that status messages, success/error states, and performance icons remain consistent across all interfaces:

* **Standardized Symbols**: 
  * 🐇 **Rabbit (Cache)**: Optimized for single-threaded gaming latency (CCD0).
  * 🐆 **Cheetah (Frequency)**: Optimized for multi-threaded compute throughput (CCD1).
  * ♊ **Dualize**: Both CCDs active for maximum width.
  * 🦅 **Boost**: High-performance state enabled.
* **Unified Logic**: UI tokens are defined in `x3d-xui.sh` and automatically injected into the C backend during the build process, ensuring perfect alignment between the CLI and the background daemon.

### 📦  Installation Methods 📦

#### 1. Arch Linux / Garuda (via Pre-compiled Pacman Package)

If you download the compiled Arch package directly from the **Releases** page (`.pkg.tar.zst`), you can install it seamlessly using `pacman` without needing to compile it yourself:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/
sudo pacman -U x3d-toggle-*.pkg.tar.zst
```

#### 2. Arch Linux / Garuda (via Local PKGBUILD / Git Clone)

For developers or those wanting to compile directly from the absolute latest commits dynamically. The `makepkg` command automatically builds the C binary and wraps it into a `pacman` installation for you:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyrotiger/x3d-toggle-main.git
cd x3d-toggle
makepkg -si
```

#### 3. Manual Build (Make - Debian/Fedora/Ubuntu/Etc)

If you are running a non-Arch distro without `pacman` or `makepkg`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyrotiger/x3d-toggle-main.git
cd x3d-toggle
make
sudo make install
```

### 🎮  Application Usage  🎮

* Launch the GUI/Interface via your application launcher (search for "X3D CCD Control") or execute via terminal:

  ```bash
  x3d-toggle
  ```

* Accepted Application/Desktop Launcher Keywords: `x3d` `x3d-toggle` `vcache` `cpu` `rabbit` `cheetah` `llm` `encode` `streaming` `workload` `compute` `elk`
* **Note on Desktop Shortcuts:** In Arch Linux, packages securely place their `.desktop` files in your Application Launcher (`/usr/share/applications/`), rather than forcing icons onto your physical Desktop. If you prefer a literal shortcut icon on your Desktop, simply run this command:

  ```bash
  cp /usr/share/applications/x3d-toggle.desktop ~/Desktop/ && chmod +x ~/Desktop/x3d-toggle.desktop
  ```

### ⚙️  Background Daemon & Utilities  ⚙️

#### Automated Scheduling Service 🎹

Enable the system service to allow the background daemon to dynamically switch your system between Cache and Frequency profiles based on live workloads:

Enable the system service to allow the background daemon to dynamically switch your system between Cache and Frequency profiles based on live workloads.

**Via Systemd:**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now x3d-toggle.service
```

**Via X3D CLI (Recommended):**

```bash
x3d start   # Hard Wake: Enable autostart + Start session
x3d enable  # Soft Wake: Start session only
```

#### Configuration Overrides  🔧

To fine-tune the daemon's behavior, edit the **Default Configuration** file `/etc/x3d-settings.conf` (Requires `sudo`).
More advanced, persistent overrides can be found in the **User Configuration** directory at `/etc/x3d-toggle.d`.

* **POLL_INTERVAL:** Adjust how frequently the daemon checks for state changes in seconds (Default: 3).
* **COMPUTE_LOAD_THRESHOLD:** Set the CPU usage percentage required to trigger Cheetah/Frequency mode (Default: 50).
* **GAME_DETECTION_MODE:** Select the method used to detect Gaming/Rabbit mode intent (Default: 2).
  * Mode `1`: Simplified legacy detection (Gamemoded + Steam).
  * Mode `2`: Advanced dynamic detection. Caches your installed application metadata (`.desktop` fields) and continually matches it against `top` resource utilization and steam usage.

* **Note:** After editing, restart the daemon to apply changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart x3d-toggle.service
   ```

### 📟  CLI Command Lifecycle  📟

* Review [x3d-toggle.1](x3d-toggle.1) for more information

### 🚮  Uninstallation  🚮

To uninstall all binaries and assets, run the following:

```bash
cd to /path/to/folder/x3d-toggle
sudo make uninstall
```
